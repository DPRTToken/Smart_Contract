DPRT Token Smart Contract
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

DPRT Token is build on Ethereum Platform.
Smart contracts are contracts whose terms are encoded in  computer language instead of legal language. 
Smart contracts can be executed by a computing network such as RSK, so that the terms of the contracts 
are automatically enforced by a protocol that all nodes in the network follow. A smart contract can be fully autonomous if all the objects referred (such as currency, payments, obligations, property titles, assets, licenses) have a digital representation in the platform. 
Please see the Standard DPRT Token smart contract already open and publish to all publics.
